# Your Joomla Development Workflow

This is a presentation on how to use various coding tools to help you work with Joomla projects. After cloning this repository, you'll want to get the submodules that contain the template Git example. To do that, go to the command line, change directory to the repository root, then run the following commands:

	$ git submodule init
	$ git submodule update

This will tell your repository to pull in the separate repository for the rhuk\_milkyway\_version\_controlled example. Once everything is checked out, copy the entire folder over a clean Joomla installation, then create a menu item pointing to the Outline view of the Workflow component. Follow this link in the frontend to start the presentation.
